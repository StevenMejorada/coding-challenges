# coding-challenges

This repository is contains a compilation of code challenges from various websites such as frontendmentor.io.

Project 1 and Project 2
The purpose of this project is to practice my positioning skills. I created only the web version of the challenges, and thus there are no media queries here.
I will return to these projects once I've better understanding of responsiveness, element naming conventions and the use of utility classes.
